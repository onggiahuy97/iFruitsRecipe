# iFruitsRecipe

This is a project I created for my CS 152 class at San Jose State University. It is a recipe app that features a variety of fruit-based recipes.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Xcode installed on your computer. Once you have Xcode installed, simply download the project files and open them in Xcode. You should then be able to build and run the project.

## Usage

Once you have the project running, you can browse through the recipes and select the one you want to make. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions, so you should be able to follow along easily.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to submit a pull request. I am always looking for ways to improve the app and add new features.
